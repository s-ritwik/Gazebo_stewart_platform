# 6DOF Parallel Manipulator (Stewart Platform) Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of a 6DOF Parallel Manipulator, also known as a Stewart Platform. This project is inspired by **HadiYd's work** but is tailored to not require constant Reinforcement Learning (RL) training. The goal of this simulation is to provide a simplified and computationally efficient way to simulate and control a Stewart Platform for various applications.

## Features
- Simulates a full 6 Degree of Freedom (DOF) Stewart Platform.
- Provides a flexible control framework without the need for constant RL training.
- Designed for easy integration into robotics and control systems.
- Real-time visualization of the manipulatorâ€™s movement.

## Installation Guide
  To be updated with all the details soon.
